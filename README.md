👋 Hi, I’m @yousefkhawagh

👀 I’m interested in DevOps, Cloud Computing, Infrastructure as Code, and automation tools like Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, and Terraform.

🌱 I’m currently learning more about AWS services, CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins and GitHub Actions, and monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source DevOps projects, cloud infrastructure setups, or automating deployment workflows.
